# we got a project to make an Image processing system that can monitoring plant growth in controlled environment as a mini project . the codes i have made i uploaded here.

## I used anaconda navigator with jupyter note book to do that project and used image processing libraries such as openCv ,numpy and matplotlib.

## we planted a plant for the project to monitoring. uubfortunally it give us only two leaves. however the code segments and other things working properly. these codes measuring growth of plant by its hight, leaf count and visual texture of its leafs.it measures daily growth and show the growth pattern as a graph.i will attach some examples below.
